# docker-gvm
Docker implementation of Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) / OpenVAS

## THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MAINTAINED
Greenbone now maintains their own docker images of all GVM / Openvas components - 
<https://hub.docker.com/u/greenbone>

## Source repo
<https://github.com/isaudits/docker-gvm>

## Run notes
The easiest way to run is using docker-compose. An example compose file can be
found in the github repo at <https://github.com/isaudits/docker-gvm/blob/master/docker-compose.yml>.

The sample compose file references an .env file for defining environment variables
at config/local.env; a sample .env file can also be found in the github repo.

## Environment variables
The following environment variables can be defined in your docker-compose file or
the referenced .env file, or can be passed into docker command line:

- UPDATE_ON_START - run feed update script on launch
- PUID - PID of non-root user (1000)
- PGID - GID of non-root user (100)
- TZ - Time Zone (America/New_York)
- GVM_USER - username of default GVM user (admin)
- GVM_PASSWORD - password for default GVM user (admin - can be changed in GSA later)
- GVMD_MAX_IPS_PER_TARGET - Max hosts per scan target (4096) 
- GSA_TIMEOUT - HTTP timeout for GSA (600)
- SMTP_HOST - SMTP relay for emailing reports
- SMTP_PORT - SMTP relay port
- SMTP_MASQ - SMTP masquerade domain


## Version / upgrade notes

### General
When launching a new build that requires a DB schema migration, the migration will fail while there are any plugin
updates being processed. This will likely occur if your instance is configured to download plugin updates on startup.

If you see error messages in the console such as "SCAP sync already running" followed by
"gvmd: cannot migrate SCAP database" then an ongoing sync is preventing the initial migration from taking place.
GVMD will fail to launch until this process is completed, so just allow the process to complete and GVMD should
eventually start.

Major updates to schema could require some database tables to be reinitialized. GVMD will do this upon start, however
GSA will not load until this process completes and the GVMD daemon is started.

TLDR; upon first launch, just walk away for a bit and have a coffee!
### 21.4
No known upgrade issues from 20.8.1 build or higher. Previous build notes apply to upgrades from previous builds. 
Going forward, release build tags will only be updated to a new tag if minor release causes upgrade or dependency
issues as was the case from 20.8 to 20.8.1. Major releases (e.g. 21.4 vs 20.8 will continue to receive new build tags).
### 20.8.1 / 20.8.2
Upgraded base image from 20.8 release to Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) due to required dependency versions not being upgraded in
18.04 (Bionic). This also results in an upgrade of Postgres from 10 to 12, which will require the GVM
database to either be manually updated or recreated. 

At this point, we have not found a simple way to perform an in-place upgrade of the database. 
You can TRY the following steps at your own risk (this is unsupported and we will not accept any
blame if you brick a production database nor will we respond to any support requests for assistance
with upgrading a database).

    # backup existing volume
    docker volume rm gvm_db_bak
    docker volume create gvm_db_bak
    docker run --rm -it -v gvm_db:/from -v gvm_db_bak:/to alpine ash -c "cd /from ; cp -av . /to"

    # export data to temp volume
    docker volume rm gvm_db_temp
    docker volume create gvm_db_temp

    # use 20.8 image to export database
    docker run --rm -it -v gvm_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data -v gvm_db_temp:/backup --entrypoint /bin/bash isaudits/gvm:gvm-20.8 

    # dump gvm database 
    s6-setuidgid postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/postgres &
    sudo -u abc pg_dump -O gvmd >/backup/gvmd_dump.sql
    exit

    # use 20.8.1 image to restore database
    docker volume rm gvm_db
    docker volume create gvm_db
    docker run --rm -it -v gvm_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data -v gvm_db_temp:/backup --entrypoint /bin/bash isaudits/gvm:gvm-20.8.1

    # initialize GVMD database and restore backup
    cat /etc/cont-init.d/50-postgres | /bin/bash
    s6-setuidgid postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/12/bin/postgres &
    sudo -u abc psql -f /backup/gvmd_dump.sql gvmd
    exit

    # undo if something screws up
    docker volume rm gvm_db
    docker volume create gvm_db
    docker run --rm -it -v gvm_db_bak:/from -v gvm_db:/to alpine ash -c "cd /from ; cp -av . /to"

    # if all looks ok, delete temp volumes
    docker volume rm gvm_db_temp
    docker volume rm gvm_db_bak

### 20.8
When upgrading from GVM 11, the system has to migrate default reports from those included
with source of GVM 11 (/usr/local/share/gvm/gvmd/report_formats/) to the new feed based
reports. This process fails if the directory is empty (which is the case when this directory
lives inside a docker image for version 11). Solution was to populate this directory inside
the image from our GVM11 base image

Default path for ospd socket has changed from /tmp/ospd.sock to /var/run/ospd/ospd.sock;
This path has to be changed in the ospd.conf file. Solution was to implement commands
on startup to set default values in ospd.conf

Have to manually change scanner pid path on existing scanner if upgraded from GVM 11;
on portainer, use command shell as user abc:
```
gvmd --get-scanners
gvmd --modify-scanner=<UUID> --scanner-host=/var/run/ospd/ospd.sock
```
